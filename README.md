The Java Web Development Guide takes you from your first servlet and JSP \(Java Server Page\) to developing a complete website. This guide contains lessons that will give you a jump start on your career. Detailed instructions enable you to successfully complete the many problems. You'll get immediate feedback as you check them against supplied solutions. Programming challenges will keep you engaged, interested and on your toes.

You will develop skills creating servlets and JSPs. You’ll use Expression Language \(EL\) and JSTL \(JSP Standard Tag Library\). You'll create a website which remembers information between visits using sessions and cookies. You’ll connect to an Oracle database using the Java Persistence API \(JPA\) just like the pros do. And you will develop applications using the MVC design pattern. So you’ll learn best practices from the experiences of others.
