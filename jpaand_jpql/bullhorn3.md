# Bullhorn \#3

There's more work to do. Make your Bullhorn application complete with user profiles.

* Each user should have their own profile page. 
* On the post stream page, list the posts with the poster's name as a link. 
* When the current user \(whether logged in or not\) clicks the link the profile page for the poster will display 
  * The profile includes the name, motto, and join date of the poster 
  * This page should also have a list of their posts. 
* Display the posts in reverse chronological order 
* Test your application with three different users each with five to seven posts.
