# Deluxe Shopping Cart

Your client, Dave and Alton, have thought of something else for their application. This happens all the time.

1. Modify your Shopping Cart Application to include a Login page and add a button which allows a logged in user to place an order. The button should be visible for logged in users but not visible for others. However, any user can add to the shopping cart.
2. The user's name should display on every page when they are logged in. If the user is not logged in then a link should appear instead of the user name to allow the user to log in.
3. The background color of the application should be different for a logged in user than for a user who is just browsing.
4. Once the user places the order you application should save the shopping cart to the database.
   1. Create at least five unit tests and a test suite to run them all.
