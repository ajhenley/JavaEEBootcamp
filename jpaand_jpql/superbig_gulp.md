# Super Big Gulp!

> JPA allows you to change the database without changing your code

When you developed the Big Gulp application you linked it to Oracle. Your company's accountant spent all weekend looking for places to cut costs. He thinks the Oracle license costs are too high.

The accountant wants to know if you could live with a less expensive database. You can. But not until you change your application. It must no longer depend on Oracle. If you use JPA then you can make your application work with any database.

## Your Assignment

1. Copy your Big Gulp application to a new dynamic web application.
2. Change your new application to use JPA and remove references to Oracle.
