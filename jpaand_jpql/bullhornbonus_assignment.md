# Bullhorn Bonus Assignment

The users love Bullhorn. They're going crazy. But they're also making new requests. Your project manager has listed the most requested features below. Your job now, as a veteran employee of the Bullhorn Website Company is to implement the top requests.

## Your assignment

1. Extend your bullhorn application to allow the users to link to a photo that will display on their profile page. A smaller \(24x24\) version of this same image should appear next to each post by that user.
2. Extend your bullhorn application to allow the user to send a private "direct message" to a single user. If the user submits a message that looks like this:

   ```text
   @dave Hey, It Works!
   ```

Then @dave should see a message marked "private" in his feed that he only sees when he is logged in.

1. Extend your bullhorn application to allow the user to see all the messages \(normal or private\) that they have submitted in chronological order.
