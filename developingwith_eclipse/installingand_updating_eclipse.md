# Installing and updating Eclipse

Installing Eclipse is simple. It just involves unzipping the downloaded file into a directory. After unzipping the Eclipse IDE is ready to run. You may wish to create a shortcut to the executable on your desktop to simplify starting Eclipse.

Eclipse can be run by executing the file startup.jar. If Java Environment \(JAVA\_HOME\) variables are defined then Eclipse IDE will automatically detect the JRE and start running.

## Updating Eclipse

There is a wide variety of plugins for various programming languages and other development-oriented tools \(such as modeling, database browsing, etc.\).
