* All assignments by a student
* All assignments of a particular type by anyone
* All assignments of a particular type by a particular student
* The average for a student
* The average for a student by assignment type
* The highest and lowest grade for a particular assignment type \(highest quiz grade, lowest project grade, etc\)
