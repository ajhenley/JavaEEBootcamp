# Big Gulp!

## Changing Requirements

Surprise! The client just called. They've changed their mind! You need to change your application to handle the following:

* The restaurant can change its name or address but the existing reviews stay with it
* The user can change their email and their reviews will reflect the new name
* The user can edit any of their reviews

## Your Assignment

Modify your Gulp application to implement the above requests. Do a good job and the client may take you out for a slupee later. Or a Big Gulp!
