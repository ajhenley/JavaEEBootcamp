# Gulp! Assignment

You've been hired! It's a new start-up. They need you to develop their application, Gulp! \(think Yelp! without pictures or maps\).

## Your Assignment

Create a new dynamic web application. It should allow users to rate and/or review their favorite restaurants.

Each user should be able to do the following:

* Rate a restaurant on a scale of 0-5 stars
* Write a review of a restaurant. Each review should include the rating and the date reviewed.
* View a restaurant to see the average rating, number of ratings and a list of all the reviews. Reviews should list the name, address and description of the restaurant.
* Allow a user to create a profile including their: name, email and ZIP. The profile page should list all the ratings and reviews made by that user.
* List restaurants by the average rating.
* Your application should allow a user to enter just one review for any particular restaurant. 
* A restaurant may have any number of reviews. A user can review any number of restaurants.
* Your data must include at least three users, five restaurants and twelve reviews.

## DESIGN BEFORE YOU CODE

You need to talk about everything you want to do before you do it. You might even want to sketch it out before you proceed.
