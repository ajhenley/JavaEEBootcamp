# Servlet Assignment

The Deputy Administrator of NOAA \(the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\) has contacted you. They need you to develop an important application for their service. It seems that they are planning to go metric and heard you know how to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celcius.

## Your Assignment

1. Create a NEW Dynamic Web application. It should contain an index.html page, a servlet and a JSP page. 
2. The starting page for your application will be index.html. This should allow the user to enter the Fahrenheit temperature. 
3. Create a form with a submit button. It will pass the temperature to the servlet. The servlet will calculate the Celcius temperature. You can calculate the Celcius temperature by taking the Fahrenheit temperature and subtracting 32. Multiply that result by 5/9.0 to get the Celcius temperature.
4. Create a jsp called output.jsp. The Celcius temperature will be output to output.jsp. Output.jsp will display both the Fahrenheit and the Celcius temperature.
5. Optional: Make your site look marvelous with Bootstrap.
