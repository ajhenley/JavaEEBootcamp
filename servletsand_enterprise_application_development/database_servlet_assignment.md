# Database Servlet Assignment

The moment has arrived when you will apply your Oracle knowledge to a servlet. Just like you retrieved data from Oracle into a java application you will retrieve the data into a servlet. Just format it for output as a jsp instead of a console application. Instead of using `System.out.println`.... you'll apply your servlet powers to set attributes and forward to an output page. Cool, eh?

## Your Assignment

1. Create a new Dynamic Web Application.
2. Create a servlet that outputs the name of the customer from DemoCustomer with the id of 2 to a Bootstrap web page. If you don't have the DemoCustomer table then use which ever table you have that contains people's names. Are you lost, dazed, confused? Refer back to the previous assignment where you created a simple Oracle connection.
