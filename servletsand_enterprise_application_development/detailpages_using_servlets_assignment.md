# Detail Pages using Servlets Assignment

Take the application that you created for the last assignment. A list of customers is helpful. But we'd like to see the details about each customer. The details should show when the user clicks on the customer's name.

## Your Assignment

1. Add a servlet that will show the detail information for one customer
2. Link the output jsp to this servlet. When someone clicks a customers name they will see the detail information about that person. Code the anchor tag that surrounds the customer's name to include a parameter in the URL. The parameter should be the customer ID. The servlet can use the customer ID to retrieve the details for that customer.
3. The servlet should output the details to another JSP page called details.jsp.
