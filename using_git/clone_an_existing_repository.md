# Clone an existing repository

The complete source code for git is stored on GitHub at [https://github.com/git/git](https://github.com/git/git). You can create a complete clone of this project on your computer in about 30 seconds. Wouldn't that be cool? This is cool because you can find projects you like and clone them to either explore their code and learn more about coding or to make changes to an existing project. You'd need to contact the project owner to find out how they might want you to submit change requests, if any, so we won't go there. Just know it's possible.

To clone the git project on your computer: 1. Using the Git shell, create a directory called git 2. Change to that directory 3. Type git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)/ 4. Wait just a minute or two for all the files to finish downloading

You now have the git source code on your computer.
