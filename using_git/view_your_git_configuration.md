# View your Git configuration

Configuration files are just simple text files.

Use the `git config` command to manipulate the entries in your configuration file directly.

The most common thing youâ€™ll need to do is set your identity. You do this by typing

`git config user.name "Your Name"` and also

`git config user.email "your email address"`.

When you simply type `git config` you will be presented with all the options for the command.

You can check your settings with `git config --list`. If you run that command you will see all your configuration settings.

Can you find your user name and email address in that list?
