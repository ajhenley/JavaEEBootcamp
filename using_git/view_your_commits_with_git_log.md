# View your commits with Git log

The `git log` command shows a sequential history of the individual commits with a repository.

You can also filter the view to include only a particular branch.

The entries are listed from newest to oldest. Each entry shows the commit number along with the authorâ€™s name and email as well as the date of the commit.

You can get more information about a commit with `git show <commit_id>` where  represents the commit number from git log. If you tag your commits you can replace  with the tag.
