# Checking Status

At any time in the Git directory you can type  to check the status of your repository.

Most of the time you'll see something like this:

```text
MyProject>git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

When there are changes to your files or changes to be added to your repository you'll get messages about those as well.

Git status will read the index and report the current state of the working directory and the index.
