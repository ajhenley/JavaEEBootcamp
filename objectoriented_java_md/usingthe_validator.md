# Using the Validator

Using the Validator class you created in the last lesson, create a new application that asks the user for their personal information:

* Name
* Age \(between 1 and 100\)
* Height \(between 36 and 92 inches\)
* Weight \(between 80 and 400 lbs\) 
* Favorite decimal number \(between 0 and 1\). 

  The application should validate the range and the data types of these entries and output the information to the console.
