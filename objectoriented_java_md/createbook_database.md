# Create book database

A book database class will contain a method to return a book object. We haven't exactly learned how to create a database or read/write to files yet. We're going to use the knowledge we already have to create a class. Our class will simulate a database and return a populated book object. We'll simulate a database by simply using if or switch statements to look up a book based on SKU. Later, we'll create a database using Oracle that also returns a book object.

Our book database will contain several book titles and the SKU code to look one up. Your assignment

## Your assignment

Create a class that contains a method that takes one parameter, the SKU, and returns a corresponding book object. Use If Statements to populate the instance variables of the Book class and return the populated Book class.
