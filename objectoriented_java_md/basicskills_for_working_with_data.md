## The Eight Primitive Data Types

| Type | Bytes | Use |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| byte | 1 | Very short integers from -128 to 127 |
| short | 2 | Short integers from -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | 4 | Integers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long | 8 | Long integers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float | 4 | Single-recision, floating-point numbers from -1.7E308 to 1.7E308 with up to 16 significant digits. |
| char | 2 | A single Unicode character that's stored in two bytes. |

How to declare and initialize a variable in one statement

Syntax:

Examples:

A variable stores a value that can change as a program executes. Before you can use a variable, you must declare its data type and initialize it by assigning a value to it.

To declare and initialize more than one variable for a single data type in a single statement, use commas to separate the assignments. To identify float values, you must type an f or F after the number. To identify long values, you must type an l or L after the number.
