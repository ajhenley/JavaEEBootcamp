# What if activity

Create a program that allows the user enter a sales record \(which includes customer number, name, sales amount and a tax code\).

| tax code | tax amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| NRM | 6% |
| NPF | 0% |
| BIZ | 4.5% |

The program should output a total that includes the tax owed \(if any\).
