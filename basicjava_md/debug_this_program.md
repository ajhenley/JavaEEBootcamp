# Debug this program

This program is trying to assign two values to two variables, but if you put it in Eclipse it won't successfully run. Find and fix the error.

```java
public class DebugProg {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x, y;

        x = 3.1415;
        y = 3.64;

        System.out.println("pi is approximately " + x);
        System.out.println("My GPA was " + y);
    }
}
```
