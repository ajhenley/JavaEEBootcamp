# Change program

By now, you should be comfortable with both writing programs and debugging programs \(making a broken program work\). This is a new type of assignment. Here we want to take a working program and change it to do something else.

```java
public class ChangeProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x, y, z;

        x = 5;
        y = 9;

        z = x * y;

        System.out.println("The product is " + z);
    }
}
```

Change this program to output the product of 5 and 8.75.
