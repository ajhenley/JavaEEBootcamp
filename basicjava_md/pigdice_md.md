# A variation on the dice game Pig \(move\)

Create a program that will randomly select two numbers from 1-6 \(like rolling two dice\). Show the dice rolls. You should also show the running score. Prompt the user to either roll again or lose their turn. A player scores the sum of the two dice thrown and gradually reaches a higher score as they continue to roll. If a single number 1 is thrown on either die, the score for that whole turn is lost. However a double 1 counts as 25. When you reach a score of 100 \(or more\) the game ends.

Example output:

```text
You roll: 5 and 3. Your score is 8. 
Press Y to roll again.
```
