# Guessing game

I'm thinking of a number. Guess it. If you've ever played that game of some version of it then you're ready for the next assignment. The computer will "pick" a number. Actually, you'll program one in the code. You can use a random number if you're ambitious.

Create a number-guessing game using a while loop. The loop will allow users to guess _until_ they get the number right. Your program will keep looping as long as the guess is different from the secret number.

The output should look like this:

```text
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Try to guess it.
Your guess: 5
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 4
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 8
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 6
That's right! You're a good guesser.
```
