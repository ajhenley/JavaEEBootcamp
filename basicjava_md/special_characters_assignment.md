# Special characters assignment

Sadly, this application doesn't work... but you're the person who can fix it.

This is more difficult than you think unless you work through it methodically. Fix the variables message1 and message2 so the program prints the following:

```text
message1 = \/\/\/\/\/\r\t\b
message2 = ";
```

You should not add any new lines of code. In other words, do not add additional System.out.println\(\) statements. You can do it. The world believes in you!
