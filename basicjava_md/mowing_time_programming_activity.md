# Mowing time programming activity

Bob has a lawn service business. Bob estimates that he can mow 40 sq yard of lawn in 2 minutes. Write a program that will allow Bob to enter the length and width of a lawn. The program should then compute the square yardage and the time it will take to mow it. Display the length, width, square yardage, and the amount of time to mow it.
