# Working with files

Sometimes you want to save data to work with another day. Or to share between systems. That's when you save your data to a file or database. We'll look at databases later. For now, let's write and read data to a file.

The following application will prompt the user to enter their favorite movies. When they are done it will list the movies. Each movie will be saved to a file so that the program can be run another day and keep track of all the movies.

The File class is used to create files and directories. The methods of the File class can be used to delete or rename files. It can also be used to see if a file exists.

An object of type File is used to represent either a file or a directory.
