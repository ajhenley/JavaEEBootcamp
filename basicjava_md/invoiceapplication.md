# Invoice application

Create an application that allows the user to enter a tax rate followed by any number of prices. When the user enters a price of 0.0, the application should print out the list of prices entered followed by the subtotal, tax and grand total

The program should run something like this:

```text
Tax Rate ? : .05
Price # 1   : 2.34
Price # 2  : 3.0
Price # 3   : 5.50
Price # 4   : 0.0

--------------------------------------------

Receipt
2.34
3.00
5.50
10.84 subtotal
.542  tax
11.36  grand total
```
