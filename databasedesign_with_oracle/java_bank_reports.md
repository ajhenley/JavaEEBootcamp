# Java Bank Reports

This assignment is more difficult than the others. You may want to work with a partner.

Your bosses at Java Bank want you to extend the banking application with a series of reports. You need to formulate the queries that will pull this data. Create the tables, load the data, and write the report queries.

| Name | StartingBalance | Account Type | AccountNumber |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Barney | 1000 | Checking | 77 |

Charizard\|1200\|Checking\|81\| \|Super Saiyan\|200000\|Money Market\|18\| \|Oscar the Grouch\|.93\|Savings\|30

| Transaction Id | User Id | Amount | Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 30 | -34 | 8/1 |
| 2 | 81 | 1200 | 8/2 |
| 3 | 30 | -45 | 8/2 |
| 4 | 18 | .12 | 8/3 |
| 5 | 30 | -.05 | 8/3 |

## Reports Needed:

* Transaction Summary for an Account \(Given an account\_id, it should show all the information for the account and the transaction history for the account\)
* Current Balances \(Should show the current balance for all accounts.\)

## What else to do

Add additional accounts and transactions. Do the reports work the way you expect?
