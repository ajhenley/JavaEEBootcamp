# Java Bank Database

You have been asked to take Java Bank into the 21st century by designing a database for their online bank. Go back to the application you wrote and create a set of tables that will handle user accounts, deposits, withdrawals, checks and debit transactions.

It should also allow the bank to save all transactions so that there is a history of everything that has been done.

Create multiple tables and figure out how they relate to each other.
