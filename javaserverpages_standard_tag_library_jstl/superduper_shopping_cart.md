# Super Duper Shopping Cart

The shopping cart applications are looking great! Now let's add some new features.

> Once you complete the Super Shopping Cart post it to GitHub.

## Branching in Git

You will need to create a branch in your project to work on the next set of features. As you finish a feature then merge the branch with the Master branch and commit your project. This way each feature is its own branch and doesn't break the master branch.

Test each branch with unit tests. Merge to master once your branch works.

## Your Assignment

* Create a branch called AcceptPayment. Then add a feature where the user can pay with a credit card and can have a shipping address and a billing address. Payments and addresses should be tracked in the database as well.
* Create a branch called StoreCredit. Then add a feature where the administrator can issue a credit to a user. For example, the administrator should be able to issue a $25.00 credit to a particular user. When that user purchases something then that user should get he $25.00 credit automatically applied to their order. So their payment amount is reduced by the $25.00.
* Create a branch called ViewPastOrders. Then add a feature where the user can... um, ... view past orders.

## Bonus...

* Add a wish list linked to each user
