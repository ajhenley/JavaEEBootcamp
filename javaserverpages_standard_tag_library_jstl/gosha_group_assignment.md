# Gosh! A group assignment

Gosh! is a online retailer that used to sell their crafts on Etsy. Due to a contract dispute they are no longer Etsy and they are now losing $1,500 a day in lost sales. They need you to create a new online marketplace for them. One like Etsy, but their own.

Next weekend promises to be a big weekend for them so they want their site ready by then.

Work with your team members to divide up the work. Organize your work. Unorganized teams work late at night and on the weekend.

Think about code reuse. Most of the functionality for this application already exists in your last couple of projects. The less code you write the faster you can develop this solution.

Think about design FIRST. Get the database working before you start writing code. Make sure you understand the database before you code. It also helps to enter some test data before starting your project.

> Use GitHub to share code. If you have database files to exchange then create scripts and exchange them through GitHub as well.

Work with your group to create an application that will provide the following:

* Allow new users to sign up and create their own accounts
* Allow users to post items for sale; each item should have a name, a link to a picture, a description, a price and a shipping cost.
* Allow users to view a list of the items that they have available for sale.
* Allow users to edit the items that they have available for sale.
* Allow users to make an item unavailable for sale. Label unavailable items as NOT FOR SALE.
* Allow users to view a list of all their purchases.
* Allow anyone to browse items for sale
* Allow anyone to search the items for sale
* Require someone to login in order to add an item to their shopping cart
* Thanks to a student's wonderful suggestion, you should also accept returns. A return will make the item available for sale again. Give the customer a credit for the amount of the item.
