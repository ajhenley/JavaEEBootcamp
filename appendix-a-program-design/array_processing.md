# Array Processing

## Objective

* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing **input, output,**and **processing steps**
* What control structures \(sequence, selection and repetition\) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

## Create an algorithm to:

1. Find the sum of the elements of an array
2. Find the mean \(average\) of the elements of an array.
