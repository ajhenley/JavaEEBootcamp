# Designing Programs

Programmers need to have a good understanding of the data to be processed. This includes the data variables, constants and literals. It also includes elementary data items, data structures, files and data validation.

## Steps in program development

* Define the problem.
* Outline the solution.
* Develop the outline into an algorithm.
* Test the algorithm for correctness.
* Code the algorithm into a specific programming language.
* Run the program on the computer.
* Document and maintain the program.

## Three different approaches to program design:

* procedure-driven
* event-driven
* data-driven program design.

## Procedural programming

## Object-oriented programming

## Top-down development

## Modular design

## Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of detailed, unambiguous and ordered instructions developed to describe the processes necessary to produce the desired output from the given input.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an English language-like way of representing the algorithm

### Advantages of Pseudocode

Easy to read, write and test before you have committed to development of your program.

### Conventions for Pseudocode
