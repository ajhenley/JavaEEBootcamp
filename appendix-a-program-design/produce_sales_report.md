# Produce Sales Report

* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing **input, output,**and **processing steps**
* What control structures \(sequence, selection and repetition\) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

Design a program that will read a file of sales records and produce a sales report. Each record in the file contains a customer's number and name, a sales amount and a tax code. The tax code is to be applied to the sales amount to determine the sales tax due for that sale, as follows:

| Tax Code | Sales Tax |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | tax exempt |
| 1 | 3% |
| 2 | 5% |

The report must print a heading, "Sales Report", followed by detail lines. Each detail line must list the customer number, name, sales amount, sales tax and the total amount due.
