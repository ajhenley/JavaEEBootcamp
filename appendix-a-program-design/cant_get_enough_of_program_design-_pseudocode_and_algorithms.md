# Can't Get Enough of Program Design, Pseudocode and Algorithms

## Objective

* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing **input, output,**and **processing steps**
* What control structures \(sequence, selection and repetition\) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

Every day, a researcher receives 15 measurements. He needs a program written that will accept each measurement and convert it to its metric equivalent. The result shall display on the monitor. After all 15 measurements are entered, the words "All measurements processed" shall be displayed on the screen.

## 1.Receive 15 measurements \(DOWHILE\)

Create a solution algorithm and pseudocode that solves the problem using the DOWHILE loop. It checks the condition at the beginning of the loop.

## 2. Read 15 measurements \(REPEAT...UNTIL\)

Create a solution algorithm and pseudocode that solves the problem using the REPEAT ...UNTIL loop. It checks the condition at the end of the loop.

## 3. Read 15 measurements \(Counted repetition\)

Create a solution algorithm and pseudocode that solves the problem using a counted repetition loop. It uses a counter to ensure the loop repeats the proper number of times.
