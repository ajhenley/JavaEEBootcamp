# Arrays

An array is a variable that allows you to use a single variable name to be associated with all instances of that variable.

* holds a fixed number of values of a single type
* Length of an array is established when the array is created
* After creation, its length is fixed

## Array processing

* Arrays are one of the most powerful programming tools available
* Provide programmer with a way of organizing and collecting of homogeneous data items
* Allow the data elements to be contained within a single variable
* Elements \(items\) in an array are distinguished from each other via an index or subscript
* Elements in an array can be processed with either a DO loop or DOWHILE loop
* An array is a data structure that is made up of a number of variables of all the same data type.

## Typical operations on arrays

* Initialize values of the array elements
* Process each elements of the array
* Search the array for a particular element
* Write the contents of an array to a report

## Common algorithms that manipulate arrays

* Find the sum of the elements of an array
* Find the mean \(average\) of the elements of an array
* Find the largest of the elements of an array
* Find the smallest of the elements of an array
* Find the range of the elements of an array

## Initializing the elements of an array

* Load constant values into an array
* Laad initial values into an array from an input file
