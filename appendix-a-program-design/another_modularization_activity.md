# Another Modularization Activity

## Objective

* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing **input, output,**and **processing steps**
* What control structures \(sequence, selection and repetition\) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

## Create a modularized solution

A student at Java University can get a scholarship if they received at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale the previous semester.

**Create a modularized algorithm for handling**: 1. the entry of a student's grades, 2. computing their GPA, 3. determining their eligibility for a scholarship and 4. outputting either "Congrats!" or "Aw... fudgewickets!".
