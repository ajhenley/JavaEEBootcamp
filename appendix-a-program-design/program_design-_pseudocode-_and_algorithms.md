# Program Design, Pseudocode, and Algorithms

## Objective

* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing **input, output,**and **processing steps**
* What control structures \(sequence, selection and repetition\) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

## 1. Create a basic application

Your 6 year old client needs an application that will receive an integer from the user banging on the keyboard, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, and display the result to the screen.

## 2. Add three numbers and print the total

His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.

## 3. Find the average score

A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores, calculate the average score and display the result to the screen. The average score is calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.

## 4. How much water runs off the roof

How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. \(So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"\). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons \(because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches\). \(144,000/231 = 623.38\).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.
