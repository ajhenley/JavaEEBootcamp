# Shiny Web Online Bank Bootstrap Assignment

Shiny Web online bank needs to create a website for its users to do their banking online.

## Your Assignment

Create a series of pages for Shiny Web to handle their online banking including:

* Deposit Form Page
* Deposit Confirmation Page
* Balance/Transaction History Page
* Transaction History Item Detail Page
* List of Accounts Page
* Login Page

These pages should be linked using the navbar to each other. And if an item on the Transaction History page is clicked it should take you to the detail page for that item.

This site is a mockup for a working application. It doesn't need to actually do anything. It is just to show what the pages will look like.

**You must use Bootstrap.**
