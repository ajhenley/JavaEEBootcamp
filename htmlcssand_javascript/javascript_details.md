# JavaScript Details

## JavaScript is one three languages used for web development:

1. **HTML** defines the content of web pages
2. **CSS** specifies the layout of web pages
3. **JavaScript** programs the behavior of web pages

In C-like languages, the semicolon denotes the end of a statement. Unlike other C-like languages, JavaScript does not always enforce the use of a semicolon at the end of a statement. Rather, a carriage return may be "understood" as a missing semicolon, resulting in different semantics.

In JavaScript, a semicolon is automatically inserted when

* two statements are separated by a line terminator
* two statements are separated by a closing brace `}`
* a line terminator follows a `break`, `continue`, `return`, or `throw`.

Some libraries have evolved to simplify using JavaScript. This allows those who don't know all the details of the language to use it in a masterful way. JQuery and Bootstrap make your life easier.

## What can you do with JavaScript

* Select nodes by tag, id or class
* Determine if a document has finished loading
* Change the web page after it has loaded
* Validate user-entered text before it returns to the server
* Create functions that run on the client \(in the browser\)
