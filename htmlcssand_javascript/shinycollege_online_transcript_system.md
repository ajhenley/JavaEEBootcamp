# SCOTS - Shiny College Online Transcript System

Shiny College needs to create a website for its students to view their transcripts.

## Your Assignment

Create a series of pages which Shiny College students and faculty can use. The College president would like to see a demo tomorrow morning. You came highly recommended as someone who would not disappoint.

**There needs to be at least**

* Transcript Page
* Login Page
* Student Bill Page
* Instructor List
* Courses taught by instructor
* Current Schedule Page

Use the Bootstrap navbar to allow users to move around the site. Also include the instructors image on their page and the student's image on their page.

This site is a mockup for a working application. The links should work to move you between pages. Otherwise, it doesn't actually need to function. It is just to show what the pages will look like during a demo to the College president.
